# Exercise sklearn pipelines - wine quality

In this exercise you will practice working with `sklearn` pipelines. You will go through some of the typical steps in the ML model lifecycle:

* data loading
* data exploration
* splitting the data into train and test
* creating a model
* evaluating the model

You will be working with datasets related to wine quality. Each item in a dataset corresponds to a wine; based on its features, such as acidity, sugar levels, density, your model will predict the quality rating of a wine.

Click on **Use this template** and then **Open in a codespace**. When the codespace finished building the dependencies in requirements.txt should be installed.
